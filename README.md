# escarp.org drip feed

A slow-drip Atom feed of escarp.org archives, for random acts of poetry.

<!-- serendipity; refeed -->

[Feed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wong-justin/escarp.org-dripfeed/refs/heads/main/feed.xml) updated throughout the week.

<!-- Atom feed: (all) or (clean) -->

Two-hundred-something total entries. Should keep looping until the heat-death of GitHub Actions.
