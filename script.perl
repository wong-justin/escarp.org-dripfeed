# using atom instead of rss because rss is poorly-formed/ambigious/bad iirc
# some reminders on atom feed spec,
# via https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4287.txt:
# - atom feed filled with atom entries
# - either feed has an author, or all entries have an author (which in turn must have a name)
# - feed entity must also have id, title, and updated
# - feed entity should have a link rel=self (i think?)
# - entry must have id, title, updated
# - entry should have a content entity
# - content type = either text, html, or xhtml; default is text 
# - text type should be plaintext, human-readable; whitespace may be collapsed by consumer
# - html type should be escaped html, ready to render in a div, like &amp;
# - dates(datetimes) conform to rfc3339
# - ids conform to rfc3987 (internationalized URIs) (which means unique URL, probably)
#
